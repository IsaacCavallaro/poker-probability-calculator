# Suits Logic Breakdown

## `is_flush(hand)`

```python
def is_flush(hand):
    suits_in_hand = [card[0] for card in hand]
    return len(set(suits_in_hand)) == 1
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 

- It creates a new list `suits_in_hand` containing the first element (the suit) of each card in the hand
- If there is only one unique suit in the hand (i.e., if the length of the set of `suits_in_hand` is 1), then the function returns True, indicating that the hand is a flush 
- Otherwise, the function returns False.

---

## `is_full_house(hand)`

```python
def is_full_house(hand):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    return len(set(values)) == 2 and values.count(values[0]) in [2, 3]
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 

-  It creates a new list `values` containing the second element (the rank) of each card in the hand
- If there are only two unique ranks in the hand (i.e., if the length of the set of values is 2), and one of those ranks appears either two or three times in the hand (i.e., if the count of the first rank in values is either 2 or 3), then the function returns True, indicating that the hand is a full house
- Otherwise, the function returns False

---

## `is_three_of_a_kind(hand)`

```python
def is_three_of_a_kind(hand):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    return len(set(values)) == 3 and max([values.count(value) for value in set(values)]) == 3
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 

- It creates a new list `values` containing the second element (the rank) of each card in the hand
- If there are exactly three unique ranks in the hand (i.e., if the length of the set of values is 3), and the maximum count of any rank in the hand is 3 (i.e., if the maximum value of the list [values.count(value) for value in set(values)] is 3), then the function returns True, indicating that the hand is three of a kind
- Otherwise, the function returns False.

## `is_straight(hand, ranks)`



```python
def is_straight(hand, ranks):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    ranks_values = [ranks.index(value) for value in values]
    sorted_ranks_values = sorted(ranks_values)
    
    if sorted_ranks_values == [0, 9, 10, 11, 12]:
        # Special case for Ace-10 straight
        return True
    
    return sorted_ranks_values == list(range(sorted_ranks_values[0], sorted_ranks_values[-1] + 1))

```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 
- ranks 
    - list of all possible ranks, in the order they are ranked

- The function starts by extracting the rank of each card from the hand list and storing it in the values list. 
- It then maps each rank to its index in the ranks list and stores the resulting list in `ranks_values`(This is done to compare the values of the ranks later)
- Next, the function sorts `ranks_values` and stores the sorted list in `sorted_ranks_values`

- If the sorted values are equal to [0, 9, 10, 11, 12], the function returns True
    - This special case checks for an Ace-10 straight, where Ace can be either the highest or lowest card in the straight

- Otherwise, the function checks if the sorted ranks are a continuous sequence by comparing them to the list of integers generated by `list(range(sorted_ranks_values[0], sorted_ranks_values[-1] + 1))`
- If the two lists are equal, the function returns True
- Otherwise, it returns False

## `is_straight_flush`

```python
def is_straight_flush(hand, suits, ranks):
    return is_straight(hand, ranks) and is_flush(hand, suits)
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 
- suits
    - list of all possible suits
- ranks 
    - list of all possible ranks, in the order they are ranked

- The function simply returns the logical and of is_straight(hand, ranks) and is_flush(hand, suits)
- If both functions return True, then the hand is a straight flush and the function returns True
- Otherwise, it returns False.

## `is_two_pairs`

```python
def is_two_pairs(hand):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    return len(set(values)) == 3 and max([values.count(value) for value in set(values)]) == 2
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 

- This function first extracts the values of each card in the hand and saves to `values`
- If there are exactly 3 distinct values (meaning 2 pairs and 1 card)
    - It then checks if the count of the most common value is exactly 2
    - If both conditions are met
        - It returns True
        - otherwise it returns False

---

## `is_four_of_a_kind(hand)`

```python
def is_four_of_a_kind(hand):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    return len(set(values)) == 2 and max([values.count(value) for value in set(values)]) == 4
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 

- This function first extracts the values of each card in the hand and saves to `values`
- If there are exactly 2 distinct values (meaning 4 cards of one value and 1 card of another value).
    - It then checks if the count of the most common value is exactly 4
    - If both conditions are met
        - It returns True
        - otherwise it returns False

## is_royal_flush(hand, suits, ranks)
```python
def is_royal_flush(hand):
    values = [card[1] for card in hand]
    return set(values) == set(["Ace", "King", "Queen", "Jack", "10"])
```

This function takes:
 - hand 
    - list of five cards, where each card is a tuple 


- This function first extracts the values of each card in the hand and saves to `values`
- If there are exactly 5 distinct values (meaning all cards are different ranks)
    - It then checks if the set of values is exactly equal to `set(['Ace', 'King', 'Queen', 'Jack', '10'])`
    - If both conditions are met
        - It returns True
        - otherwise it returns False
